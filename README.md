## Problem Statement
Customers and hawkers often experience delays at hawker centres due to the time-consuming process of entering and verifying payments, which contributes to longer queues and disrupts stall operations.
> **How might we reduce DBS e-payment discrepancies (i.e. incorrect payments, fake screenshots) at hawker stalls cost-effectively with minimal disruption to the hawkers‚Äô operations, and provide an easier method to deal with discrepancies in the event that it happens?**

## Features
